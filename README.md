MCP WORKSHOP

Welcome to the Model Context Protocol (MCP) Workshop! This workshop is designed to help you understand the MCP from first principles and build a working understanding by implementing the core ideas in JavaScript.

🚀 Goal

Learn and build a conceptual prototype of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) using JavaScript. We’ll simulate how LLMs can interact with tools, external data sources, and memory through a structured protocol.

📚 What is MCP?

MCP (Model Context Protocol) is an open standard introduced by Anthropic in November 2024. It provides a structured way for LLMs to:
	•	Access and query external tools
	•	Retrieve and store context
	•	Compose workflows involving multiple steps
	•	Maintain a consistent schema for structured communication

🧠 Key Concepts We’ll Explore
	•	Messages and structured communication
	•	Tool use and invocation
	•	External context (retrieval, storage, reasoning)
	•	Schema design
	•	Simulated agents and tool responses

🛠 Stack

We’ll use:
	•	JavaScript (Node.js)
	•	JSON for message structure
	•	Simple local mocks for tools and memory

🧩 Structure
	•	src/
	•	index.js — Entry point for the workshop
	•	messages/ — Simulated messages and schemas
	•	tools/ — Mock external tools (e.g., calculator, search)
	•	memory/ — Contextual storage/retrieval
	•	schemas/ — Definitions for message formats
	•	README.md — This file

🏁 How to Start

npm install
node src/index.js

You’ll walk through a series of interactive steps to simulate an LLM handling a request, querying tools, and returning a structured response.

📌 Next Step

Start with a minimal index.js that loads a basic message and responds with a fixed response. We’ll iterate from there.

Let’s go!
